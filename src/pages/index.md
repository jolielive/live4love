        fighting back! Scroll through my personal experiences during the
        pandemic of keeping my 3 children and "other half" in check during
        global lock-down, while still building my business and staying creative.

        This site itself is a "salute" to DIY, with my husband (his career
        revolves around building web applications, but on a larger scale)
        donating his time to help me make my dreams of reaching like-minded
        individuals organically and creating a hub for helping others into a
        reality. The amount of small print and "scammy" solutions to even start
        blogging or selling your small "idea" has taught me so much. And now I
        want to help anyone that has similar ambitions of having any type of
        "online presence" to start out with 100% certainty that YOU are in
        control. Money should not be a thought just to TRY. Not only will you
        launch a website to start posting and selling right away, but you will
        have a collection of articles to help understand many concepts that I
        wish would have been included with many situations that I needed
        guidance with. It's not okay to have a dream and NOT be heard anymore.
        Let me shine a light on your future!
